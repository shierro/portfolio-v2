## About Me

> Tech Lead | Father of 1 | Nature Lover | Lifelong Learner | Preacher of Good News 

I've been in the tech industry for around 6 and a half years now, working with start-ups, to scale-ups, and to some corporate in the fortune 50.
Blessed to have a beautiful wife and a healthy son. Enjoys spending time with nature. 
I read a lot of books that help me become a happy and morally upright person.
I believe I've found the truth and I'm happy to share it with interested ones.
